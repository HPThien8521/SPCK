      <p>
        JavaScript is one of the most-used programming languages. It's used alot
        in apps such as Netflix, Candy Crush and many more. According to
        Northeastern University, it’s the second-most popular coding language
        out there. Clearly, JavaScript is an integral part of our daily online
        lives. But what is JavaScript exactly and what can you use it for?
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript allows you to make your website interactive. It allows for
        all the content you created with HTML and styled with CSS to become more
        engaging. From clickable buttons to log-in options, JavaScript is what
        turns your website from a wall of text into an experience.

        Of course, JavaScript wouldn’t be a cornerstone of the programming world
        if it was just about pressing buttons. The practical applications of
        JavaScript are almost endless, but we’ve highlighted some of the most
        common uses down below.

      <ul>

        <li>Image carousels to scroll through engaging content</li>
        <li>Animations to add some spice</li>
        <li>Audio and video at the click of a button</li>
        <li>Pop-ups to keep your visitors active</li>

        <li>And so much more</li>
      </ul>
